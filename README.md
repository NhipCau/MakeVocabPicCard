Automatic Vocabulary Picture Cards Maker (except for drawing pictures) for Japanese teachers. This app can create many PPT slides all at once. Made slides have some information which is Japanese Vocabulary (including Kanji), Ruby (Hiragana), and have translated languages that were indicated in the app's settings. 

You need to prepare in advance a CSV list file or an XLSX list file have written the Japanese vocabulary and rubies that you want to teach in your class.
On this app, you only need to import your list file, set some settings, and click a button to export a PPT file that has the above information.
Progressing time is very short (almost several tens of seconds to a few minutes) and you can easy to complete it.
Especially, it's very convenient for use for multiple nationalities' classes.
However, the auto translate system is used by AI Translate, occasionally you might have unmutch nuance words.Please be aware in advance.
I hope this app will help your Japanese teaching and reduce waste time for preparing for class.
